1. Broken links in selenium : if we get response code>=400
2. properties file in selenium : 
3. reusable components in framework: login,password,url,username written in a seperate method
4. maintain page elements(web elements): page object model,we are using 2 applications simultaneously, used 2 packages 2 apps, several clase each page
 by element for tetcase. 
5. pom advantage : reusability, if we want to use particular web element in 100 test cases, just pass the variable.
6. advantages of tetsng:
7. testng listners:
8. selenium desire capabilities: configure what type of browser,version, operating system
9. headless mode of testing:
10. challenges faced in automation testing: giving data, stale element exceptions,to hadle popups
11. how frequently run automation cases: 70 to 80% regression cases weekly
12. get the results in reports, what kind of reports in framework: extent reports(html, png format).
13. disadvantage of agile process: frequent requirement changes
14. n test cases, ensure how u have completed all test cases:
15: techniques of tets case writing:
16. did you miss any bugs: 
17. necessary actions when found bug in production:
18. change requet and feature request:
19. java- inheritance, collections, set and list, final key,final and finally,
20. wait,DOM,xpath in selenium:
21. super keyword, thread.sleep in java
22. thread.sleep argument as -1000: illegal argument exception
23. pom, In pom how do you declare the element:
24. which automation test cases should be picked:
25: type of popups: window based& web based,allow.accept, allow.dismiss, 
26. in how many ways we can launch an url in selenium: driver.get() & driver.navigate()
27. rules of method overriding:
28. when u will say my automation is enough and i cannot proceed now:
29: when u will do in leisure time before coming requirements: code optimization
30. java class with a name of integer: integer is a keyword, we cannot create class by using keyword.
31. can we use non static methods in method overriding:
32. in how many ways we can ue the drop down values in selenium:
33. conditional signoff:
34. error seeding:
35. tracebility matrix:
36. defect masking:
37. synchronisation in selenium:
38. procedure to take screenshot:
39. assert and soft assert:
40. if we dont do initialisation step in page factory exception: null pointer exception
41. automating api difficulties, how u are automating api:
42.
